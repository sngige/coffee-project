# Coffee App

A simple web application that helps users search for coffee shops, view their available coffee menu, and check the prices.

## Features

- Search coffee shops by restaurant name, coffee type, and country.
- View detailed menus for each coffee shop.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling.

- Font Awesome for icons.
- A local `db.json` file or API endpoint as the data source.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A local server to serve the files (recommended for fetching JSON files).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Place your `db.json` file in the project root or update the JS API URL accordingly.
3. Start a local server (e.g., using VSCode Live Server extension, `http-server`,)

### Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (via your local server).
2. Enter search terms in the "Restaurant Name", "Type of Coffee", and "Country" input fields.
3. Click the **Get Coffee** button.
4. Browse the coffee shops found, view their menus, check availability.

## Notes
